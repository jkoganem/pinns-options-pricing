## Introduction

Option pricing is a fundamental problem in quantitative finance. The Black-Scholes-Merton model [1] provides an analytical solution for European options under specific assumptions, but many practical scenarios require numerical methods. This work explores whether modern machine learning techniques, specifically Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [2], can serve as viable alternatives to classical approaches.

### Motivation

Traditional numerical methods for option pricing include:
- **Analytical formulas**: Closed-form solutions (Black-Scholes) - extremely fast but limited to simple contracts
- **Finite Difference Methods**: High accuracy but computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Versatile but slow convergence requiring millions of paths

PINNs offer a potential middle ground: they can encode the underlying partial differential equations directly into the neural network loss function, potentially achieving both accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Main Questions

1. Can PINNs match the accuracy of classical finite difference methods for European option pricing?
2. What architectural modifications are necessary to achieve competitive performance?
3. How do different methods compare in terms of accuracy, speed, and applicability?

---

## Key Findings

We find that Physics-Informed Neural Networks can achieve accuracy competitive with classical numerical methods for option pricing while offering significant computational advantages.

### Main Results

1. **Accuracy**: The optimized PINN achieves 0.064% relative error for at-the-money European call options, placing it between Crank-Nicolson (0.007%) and Monte Carlo (0.694%) methods.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: After one-time training (16 minutes), PINN inference is instantaneous (<1ms per price), matching Black-Scholes analytical formula speed while maintaining numerical accuracy comparable to PDE solvers.

3. **Architectural Contributions**: Systematic combination of three techniques proved essential:
   - **Fourier Feature Embeddings** ($\sigma$=3.0): Reduced error from 5-10% to 1-2%
   - **Learning Rate Warmup** (1000 epochs): Reduced error from 1-2% to 0.5%
   - **Exponential Moving Average** ($\beta$=0.999): Reduced error from 0.5% to <0.1%

4. **Hyperparameter Validation**: Bayesian optimization over 40 trials confirmed the baseline configuration as optimal, with lower learning rates (0.001 vs 0.002) providing better final accuracy despite slower initial convergence.

5. **Generalization**: The PINN maintains <0.1% error across the at-the-money region ($S \in [\$90, \$110]$) for all maturities, with errors increasing predictably in deep out-of-the-money regions.

6. **Physics-Informed Learning**: PDE residual analysis confirms the network successfully learns to satisfy the Black-Scholes equation throughout the computational domain, demonstrating true physics-informed behavior rather than pure data fitting.

### Practical Implications

- **Real-time Pricing**: Once trained, PINNs can price thousands of contracts in milliseconds, ideal for high-frequency trading applications
- **Greek Computation**: Automatic differentiation provides smooth, continuous Greeks without finite difference approximations
- **Scalability**: The approach extends naturally to high-dimensional problems (multi-asset options, stochastic volatility) where traditional PDE methods face the curse of dimensionality

## Mathematical Framework

### The Black-Scholes PDE

The price $V(S,t)$ of a European option on an underlying asset with price $S$ at time $t$ satisfies the Black-Scholes PDE:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + (r-q)S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0$$

where:
- $r$: risk-free interest rate
- $q$: continuous dividend yield
- $\sigma$: volatility of the underlying asset
- $S$: underlying asset price
- $t$: time

See [11] for more details on the derivation of this equation.

### Time-to-Maturity Formulation

For numerical stability, we work with time-to-maturity $\tau = T - t$, transforming the PDE to:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial \tau} = \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + (r-q)S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV$$

### Boundary and Initial Conditions

**Terminal condition** (at maturity $\tau=0$):
- **Call option**: $V(S,0) = \max(S - K, 0)$
- **Put option**: $V(S,0) = \max(K - S, 0)$

**Boundary conditions** (for $S \in [0, \infty)$):
- **Call**: $V(0,\tau) = 0$, $V(S,\tau) \to S$ as $S \to \infty$
- **Put**: $V(0,\tau) = Ke^{-r\tau}$, $V(S,\tau) \to 0$ as $S \to \infty$

where $K$ is the strike price.

### Analytical Solution (Black-Scholes Formula)

For European options, the Black-Scholes formula provides the exact solution:

**Call Option**:
$$C(S,\tau) = Se^{-q\tau}\mathcal{N}(d_1) - Ke^{-r\tau}\mathcal{N}(d_2)$$

**Put Option**:
$$P(S,\tau) = Ke^{-r\tau}\mathcal{N}(-d_2) - Se^{-q\tau}\mathcal{N}(-d_1)$$

where:
$$d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r - q + \sigma^2/2)\tau}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}$$

$$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{\tau}$$

and $\mathcal{N}(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

### Greeks: Risk Sensitivities

The "Greeks" measure sensitivities of the option price to various parameters:

**Delta** ($\partial V/\partial S$): Sensitivity to underlying price
$$\Delta_{\text{call}} = e^{-q\tau}\mathcal{N}(d_1)$$
$$\Delta_{\text{put}} = -e^{-q\tau}\mathcal{N}(-d_1)$$

**Gamma** ($\partial^2 V/\partial S^2$): Convexity, rate of change of Delta
$$\Gamma = \frac{e^{-q\tau}\phi(d_1)}{S\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}$$

**Vega** ($\partial V/\partial \sigma$): Sensitivity to volatility
$$\nu = Se^{-q\tau}\phi(d_1)\sqrt{\tau}$$

**Theta** ($\partial V/\partial t$): Time decay
$$\Theta_{\text{call}} = -\frac{Se^{-q\tau}\phi(d_1)\sigma}{2\sqrt{\tau}} - rKe^{-r\tau}\mathcal{N}(d_2) + qSe^{-q\tau}\mathcal{N}(d_1)$$

where $\phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal probability density function.

## Classical Methods

### 1. Black-Scholes Analytical Solution

The analytical formula serves as our reference implementation. For a European call option with $S=K=100$, $r=0.05$, $q=0.02$, $\sigma=0.2$, $T=1$ year, the Black-Scholes price is approximately $10.45.

**Advantages**:
- Exact solution (no numerical error)
- Instantaneous computation (microseconds)

**Limitations**:
- Only applicable to European-style options
- Requires constant parameters
- No early exercise features

### 2. Crank-Nicolson Finite Difference Method

The Crank-Nicolson scheme is an implicit finite difference method that discretizes the Black-Scholes PDE on a spatial-temporal grid. It is second-order accurate in both space and time, offering excellent stability properties.

**Discretization**:
$$\frac{V_i^{n+1} - V_i^n}{\Delta\tau} = \theta\mathcal{L}(V^{n+1}) + (1-\theta)\mathcal{L}(V^n)$$

where $\theta=0.5$ (Crank-Nicolson) and $\mathcal{L}$ is the spatial differential operator.

**Implementation Details**:
- Spatial grid: $S \in [0, 3K]$ with 501 points
- Temporal grid: $\tau \in [0, T]$ with 500 steps
- Boundary conditions enforced at each time step

**Performance**:
- Accuracy: Typically 0.005-0.01% relative error
- Computation time: ~0.02-0.05 seconds per price

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo methods simulate many possible paths of the underlying asset price using the geometric Brownian motion:

$$dS = (r-q)S \, dt + \sigma S \, dW$$

where $W$ is a standard Wiener process.

**Path Generation** (Euler-Maruyama scheme):
$$S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t \exp\left[(r - q - \sigma^2/2)\Delta t + \sigma\sqrt{\Delta t} \cdot Z\right]$$

where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$.

**Variance Reduction**: We employ antithetic variates to reduce Monte Carlo variance:
- Generate $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
- Compute paths with $Z$ and $-Z$
- Average the two payoffs

**Implementation Details**:
- 100,000 simulation paths
- 252 time steps (daily increments for 1-year option)
- Antithetic variance reduction

**Performance**:
- Accuracy: ~0.1-0.3% relative error
- Computation time: ~0.5-1.0 seconds
- Error decreases as $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ with $N$ paths

## Physics-Informed Neural Networks

### Core Concept

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [2] embed physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. Instead of relying solely on labeled data, PINNs minimize a loss function that penalizes violations of the governing PDE, boundary conditions, and initial conditions.

### Loss Function Formulation

The PINN loss function consists of three components:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{PDE}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{boundary}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{initial}}$$

**PDE Loss** (residual of Black-Scholes equation):

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{PDE}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{int}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{int}}} \left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial \tau} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} - (r-q)S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + rV\right]^2$$

**Boundary Loss**:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{boundary}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{bnd}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{bnd}}} \left[V(S_{\text{bnd}}, \tau) - V_{\text{exact}}(S_{\text{bnd}}, \tau)\right]^2$$

**Initial Loss** (terminal condition):

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{init}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{init}}} \left[V(S, 0) - \max(S - K, 0)\right]^2$$

The derivatives are computed via automatic differentiation, a key advantage of neural network frameworks.

### Network Architecture

Our optimized PINN architecture consists of:

- **Input Layer**: $(S, \tau) \to$ 2D input
- **Fourier Feature Embedding**: Random Fourier features for high-frequency learning [3]
- **Hidden Layers**: 5 layers $\times$ 128 neurons with $\tanh$ activation
- **Output Layer**: Single neuron (option price $V$)

### Architectural Enhancements

#### 1. Fourier Feature Embeddings

Standard neural networks struggle to learn high-frequency functions. Fourier features [3] address this by mapping inputs through random sinusoidal transformations:

$$\gamma(\mathbf{x}) = \left[\sin(2\pi B\mathbf{x}), \cos(2\pi B\mathbf{x})\right]$$

where $B$ is a random matrix sampled from $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Project (S, tau) to Fourier space
projected = torch.matmul(inputs, fourier_matrix)  # B ~ N(0, sigma^2 I)
features = torch.cat([torch.sin(projected), torch.cos(projected)], dim=1)
```

**Hyperparameter**: $\sigma = 3.0$ (Fourier scale) was found optimal through systematic tuning.

**Impact**: Reduced error from ~5-10% (baseline) to ~1-2%

#### 2. Learning Rate Warmup

Sudden high learning rates can cause early training instability. We implement linear warmup [4]:

$$\text{lr}(\text{epoch}) = \text{lr}_{\max} \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{\text{epoch}}{\text{warmup epochs}}\right)$$

**Configuration**: warmup_epochs = 1000, $\text{lr}_{\max}$ = 0.001

**Impact**: Reduced error from ~1-2% to ~0.5%

#### 3. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

EMA maintains a running average of model weights during training [5]:

$$\theta_{\text{ema}} \leftarrow \beta \cdot \theta_{\text{ema}} + (1-\beta) \cdot \theta$$

**Configuration**: $\beta = 0.999$ (decay rate)

**Impact**: Reduced error from ~0.5% to ~0.1%

#### 4. Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling

We use the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler:
- Monitors validation loss
- Reduces learning rate by factor 0.5 when plateau detected
- Patience: 500 epochs

**Impact**: Enables automatic fine-tuning in later training stages

### Training Configuration

**Optimal Hyperparameters** (validated configuration):

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| epochs | 30,000 | Extended training for convergence |
| learning_rate | 0.001 | Conservative for stability |
| hidden_dim | 128 | Network capacity |
| num_layers | 5 | Depth for expressiveness |
| fourier_scale | 3.0 | Frequency bandwidth |
| fourier_features | 64 | Random feature dimension |
| warmup_epochs | 1000 | Warmup duration |
| ema_decay | 0.999 | Weight averaging |
| n_interior | 2000 | PDE collocation points |
| n_boundary | 200 | Boundary condition points |
| n_initial | 1000 | Terminal condition points |

**Optimizer**: Adam with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler

**Training Time**: ~45 minutes for 30,000 epochs (CPU)

### Hyperparameter Validation

We validated the baseline configuration through systematic Bayesian optimization using Optuna [6]:
- 40 trials over ~5 hours
- Search space: learning rate, Fourier scale, warmup epochs, EMA decay, network depth
- Test conditions: 5 spot prices (OTM, ATM, ITM)

**Result**: Baseline configuration remained optimal. Trial 17 (best alternative) achieved 0.121% error across 5 spots but underperformed baseline (3.6× worse) in head-to-head ATM comparison with equal training epochs.

**Key Finding**: Lower learning rate (0.001 vs 0.002) provides better final accuracy despite slower initial convergence.

### Method Comparison

![Method Comparison](output/figures/method_comparison_atm.png)
*Figure 1: Comparison of pricing methods. Left: Option prices from different methods. Right: Relative errors vs Black-Scholes analytical solution.*

| Method | Price ($) | Error (%) | Time (s) | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Black-Scholes** | 9.227006 | 0.0000 | <0.001 | Analytical (reference) |
| **Crank-Nicolson** | 9.227661 | 0.0071 | 0.051 | 501×500 grid |
| **Monte Carlo** | 9.162932 | 0.6944 | 0.533 | 100k paths, antithetic |
| **PINN (Optimized)** | 9.221150 | 0.0635 | 961 | 30k epochs training |

**Key Observations**:

1. **Accuracy Ranking**: Black-Scholes (exact) > Crank-Nicolson (0.007%) > PINN (0.064%) > Monte Carlo (0.694%)

2. **PINN Performance**: Achieves 0.064% error, competitive with Crank-Nicolson finite difference method for practical applications

3. **Speed Considerations**:
   - **Training**: PINN requires one-time 16-minute training (30,000 epochs)
   - **Inference**: Once trained, PINN pricing is instantaneous (<1ms per price)
   - **Batch Operations**: PINN excels at pricing thousands of contracts simultaneously

### Price Surface Analysis

![Price Surface](output/figures/price_surface_analysis.png)
*Figure 2: Option price profiles across spot prices. Left: Price evolution with time to maturity. Center: PINN vs Black-Scholes at T=1yr. Right: Relative pricing errors across spot range.*

The PINN generalizes well across the entire spot price range ($S \in [\$50, \$150]$):
- **Mean error**: 0.044%
- **Max error**: 0.152% (deep OTM)
- **ATM region** ($S \in [\$90, \$110]$): <0.05% error

The higher errors in deep out-of-the-money regions are expected due to:
1. Fewer training samples in extreme regions
2. Near-zero option values amplifying relative errors
3. Black-Scholes formula approaching boundary conditions

### Greeks Analysis

![Greeks Analysis](output/figures/greeks_analysis.png)
*Figure 3: Option Greeks (risk sensitivities). Top-left: Delta (sensitivity to spot price). Top-right: Gamma (convexity). Bottom-left: Vega (sensitivity to volatility). Bottom-right: Theta (time decay).*

The Greeks exhibit expected theoretical properties:

**Delta**:
- Range: $[0, 1]$ for call options
- ATM delta $\approx 0.5$ (50% hedge ratio)
- Approaches 1 for deep ITM calls

**Gamma**:
- Maximum at ATM ($S = K$)
- Symmetric around strike
- Measures convexity of option price

**Vega**:
- Peaks near ATM
- Represents sensitivity to volatility changes
- Critical for volatility trading strategies

**Theta**:
- Negative for long call positions (time decay)
- Most negative near ATM
- Accelerates as expiration approaches

### Training Convergence

![Training Convergence](output/figures/training_convergence.png)
*Figure 4: PINN training dynamics over 30,000 epochs. Left: Raw loss. Right: Smoothed loss (window=100).*

Training observations:
1. **Warmup Phase** (epochs 0-1000): Gradual learning rate increase prevents early instability
2. **Rapid Descent** (epochs 1000-10000): Primary loss reduction
3. **Fine-tuning** (epochs 10000-30000): ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler enables automatic refinement
4. **Final Loss**: $\sim 10^{-5}$ after 30k epochs

The smoothed curve shows consistent descent without catastrophic divergence, validating the stabilization techniques (warmup + EMA). However, more sophisticated stabilization techniques are likely needed for further improving performance.

### Error Heatmap Analysis

![Error Heatmap](output/figures/error_heatmap.png)
*Figure 5: PINN pricing error heatmap across spot price and time to maturity. Color intensity represents relative error percentage. The vertical dashed line marks the strike price K=$100.*

This heatmap reveals the PINN's accuracy characteristics across the entire $(S, \tau)$ domain:

**Key Observations**:
- **Lowest errors** (green regions): Near ATM and mid-to-long maturities
- **Highest errors** (red regions): Deep OTM/ITM at short maturities
- **ATM corridor**: Consistently <0.1% error across all maturities
- **Time dependency**: Errors decrease as $\tau$ increases (more time for PDE to govern)

The spatial pattern validates our training strategy: highest accuracy where options are most actively traded (near strike, longer maturities).

### Accuracy vs Computational Cost

![Method Comparison Bars](output/figures/method_comparison_bars.png)
*Figure 6: Comprehensive method comparison. Left: Pricing accuracy (lower is better). Right: Computational speed for inference (lower is better, log scale).*

**One-time Training**:
- Crank-Nicolson: Not applicable (solve each time)
- Monte Carlo: Not applicable (simulate each time)
- PINN: 16 minutes (one-time cost)

**Inference (per price)**:
- Black-Scholes: <0.001s (analytical)
- Crank-Nicolson: 0.051s (solve PDE)
- Monte Carlo: 0.533s (simulate paths)
- PINN: <0.001s (forward pass)

**Batch Pricing (1000 contracts)**:
- Black-Scholes: <0.1s
- Crank-Nicolson: ~51s
- Monte Carlo: ~533s (~9 minutes)
- PINN: <0.1s (parallel GPU inference)

**PINN Advantage**: After initial training, PINN matches analytical formula speed while maintaining <0.1% accuracy. The bar chart clearly shows PINNs achieve the optimal trade-off: near-Crank-Nicolson accuracy with near-Black-Scholes speed.

### Physics-Informed Learning: PDE Residual Analysis

![PDE Residual](output/figures/pde_residual.png)
*Figure 7: PDE residual magnitude across the computational domain. Lower values (darker regions) indicate better satisfaction of the Black-Scholes PDE. The vertical dashed line marks the strike price.*

This visualization demonstrates the **physics-informed** aspect of PINNs. The residual measures how well the neural network satisfies the Black-Scholes PDE:

$$\text{Residual} = \left|\frac{\partial V}{\partial \tau} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} - (r-q)S\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + rV\right|$$

**Key Observations**:
- **Minimal residuals** throughout most of the domain (dark regions)
- **Slightly higher residuals** near boundaries (expected, as boundary conditions dominate there)
- **Consistent performance** across different times to maturity
- The network has successfully learned to approximate solutions to the PDE, not just fit data points

This is fundamentally different from traditional supervised learning - the PINN directly encodes physical laws into its loss function.

### Greeks Surfaces: 3D Visualization

![Greeks 3D Surface](output/figures/greeks_3d_surface.png)
*Figure 8: Three-dimensional surface plots of Delta (left) and Gamma (right) across spot price and time to maturity. These surfaces reveal how hedging parameters evolve across the option's lifetime.*

The 3D visualizations provide intuition for option hedging strategies:

**Delta Surface** (Hedge Ratio):
- **Near expiration** ($\tau \to 0$): Delta transitions sharply from 0 to 1 near strike
- **Long maturity** ($\tau \to T$): Smooth transition, Delta $\approx 0.5$ at ATM
- **Practical insight**: Short-dated ATM options require frequent delta hedging due to rapid changes

**Gamma Surface** (Convexity):
- **Peak at ATM near expiration**: Maximum convexity risk for market makers
- **Decreases with maturity**: Long-dated options have lower gamma risk
- **Practical insight**: Options sellers face highest gamma risk on short-dated ATM contracts

These surfaces are computed via automatic differentiation of the PINN, demonstrating that neural networks can provide smooth, continuous Greeks without finite difference approximations.

### Comparison to Other Work

Our results are consistent with the broader literature on PINNs for option pricing.

- **Ruf & Wang (2020)** [7]: Neural networks for American options, ~1% error
- **Beck et al. (2019)** [8]: Deep learning for high-dimensional PDEs
- **Sirignano & Spiliopoulos (2018)** [9]: DGM method, ~0.1-1% error for European options

These results demonstrate that machine learning methods can match traditional finite difference accuracy while offering superior inference speed.

## Future Work

While this work demonstrates the effectiveness of PINNs for European option pricing, several promising directions remain for future investigation.

### Extensions to Complex Option Types

1. **American Options**: Extend the framework to handle early exercise features by incorporating free boundary conditions into the PINN loss function. The optimal exercise boundary could be learned implicitly through the neural network.

2. **Exotic Options**: Apply the methodology to path-dependent options (Asian, lookback), barrier options with time-dependent barriers, and multi-asset options (basket, rainbow) where the PINN's ability to handle high-dimensional problems could provide significant advantages over classical methods.

3. **Stochastic Volatility Models**: Incorporate stochastic volatility (Heston, SABR) into the PINN framework, where the curse of dimensionality makes traditional PDE methods computationally prohibitive.

### Methodological Improvements

4. **Adaptive Sampling**: Implement importance sampling for collocation points, concentrating computational effort near the strike and at short maturities where pricing errors have the greatest impact.

5. **Transfer Learning**: Investigate whether PINNs trained on one set of parameters (strike, maturity, volatility) can be fine-tuned for different parameters, potentially reducing training time for new contracts.

6. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Develop Bayesian PINNs or ensemble methods to provide confidence intervals on option prices, crucial for risk management applications.

7. **Real-time Calibration**: Extend the framework to simultaneous calibration and pricing, where model parameters (volatility surface) are learned directly from market data while maintaining PDE constraints.
